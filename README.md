# A_star
This Python class implements A* pathfinding logic. It reads the map from the local disk and navigates using up, down, left, and right directions. The class supports dynamic adjustment of floating-point variables to assign different values to the heuristic weight, allowing for flexible and customizable pathfinding behavior. This implementation provides an efficient and adaptable solution for various pathfinding needs in grid-based maps.
